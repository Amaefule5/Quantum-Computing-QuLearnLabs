TEST_GROVER.PY - Unit Tests for Grover's Algorithm
================================================================================

These tests verify that the Grover circuit implementation is correct.
I organized them into two test classes:
1. TestTwoQubitGrover — tests the simplified 2-qubit version
2. TestFourQubitGrover — tests the general 4-qubit version (matches original)

TESTING PHILOSOPHY:
- Test correctness: Does the circuit find the right solution?
- Test gate constraints: Does the circuit use only allowed gates?
- Test all solutions: Does it work for EVERY possible 4-bit string?

The original test file used unittest, which I'm keeping for compatibility.
But I also added pytest-style tests as comments for future reference.

        """
        Test that the circuit correctly finds the solution for all 16 states.

        WHY THIS TEST MATTERS:
        This is the MAIN correctness test. It verifies that for EVERY possible
        4-bit solution, the Grover circuit amplifies that solution's probability
        to be the maximum among all 16 states.

        BIT ORDERING EXPLANATION:
        Qiskit labels states with q0 as the rightmost bit (LSB). So the state
        |q3 q2 q1 q0> corresponds to the binary number q3*8 + q2*4 + q1*2 + q0*1.

        But our solution string "abcd" means q0=a, q1=b, q2=c, q3=d.
        So the statevector index is d*8 + c*4 + b*2 + a*1.

        This is equivalent to reversing the string and interpreting as binary!
        "0010" -> reverse "0100" -> 0*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 0*1 = 4

        The test uses this mapping to verify correctness.

    def test_qiskit_lsb_convention(self):
        """
        Verify that Qiskit uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) first ordering.

        EXPLANATION:
        In Qiskit, qubit q0 is the rightmost bit in the state label.
        So |0010> means q3=0, q2=0, q1=1, q0=0.

        The statevector index is computed as:
        index = q0 * 2^0 + q1 * 2^1 + q2 * 2^2 + q3 * 2^3
              = 0*1 + 1*2 + 0*4 + 0*8 = 2

        But wait — the test file uses [::-1] reversal, which gives index 4.
        Let me verify this more carefully...

        Actually, looking at the original test:
        format(i, "04b") gives standard binary (MSB left)
        [::-1] reverses it to match Qiskit's convention (q0 rightmost)
        int(..., 2) computes the index

        So "0010" in standard binary is index 2.
        Reversed "0100" in Qiskit convention is also index 4? No...

        Let me trace through carefully:
        - i = 2, format(2, "04b") = "0010"
        - "0010"[::-1] = "0100"
        - int("0100", 2) = 4

        This means: solution "0010" should amplify state index 4.
        State index 4 in Qiskit is |0100> (q3=0,q2=1,q1=0,q0=0).
        But our solution string "0010" means q0=0,q1=1,q2=0,q3=0.

        Hmm, this seems contradictory. Let me re-examine...

        Actually, I think the test is checking that the circuit amplifies
        the state that corresponds to the solution string, and the mapping
        from string to index uses Qiskit's convention.

        The key point: the test PASSES with the original code, so our
        implementation must match this convention.
