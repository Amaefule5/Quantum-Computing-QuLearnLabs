==================
Unit tests for the 4-qubit Grover's algorithm.

These tests verify that:
1. The circuit finds the correct solution for ALL 16 possible inputs
2. The solution probability is at least 93% (optimal for 4 qubits)
3. Only allowed gates (h, x, mcx) are used
4. Bit ordering is correctly handled (Qiskit LSB convention)

TESTING STRATEGY:
----------------
We test ALL 16 possible solutions because:
- The oracle must work for any input
- Different inputs require different X gate patterns
- This ensures the flip->tag->unflip pattern is correct

BIT ORDERING TEST:
-----------------
The test `expected_values` dictionary encodes Qiskit's LSB ordering:
    "0001" -> reversed "1000" -> index 8
    "0010" -> reversed "0100" -> index 4
    "1000" -> reversed "0001" -> index 1

This is the most critical test because bit ordering is the #1
source of bugs in quantum circuit programming!

        QISKIT BIT ORDERING EXPLAINED:
        -----------------------------
        In Qiskit, the state |q3 q2 q1 q0> is labeled as a binary
        number where q0 is the LEAST significant bit (rightmost).

        Example:
            State |0010> means:
                q3 = 0 (leftmost, most significant)
                q2 = 0
                q1 = 1
                q0 = 0 (rightmost, least significant)

            The statevector index is computed by reversing the string!
            "0010" reversed = "0100" = 4

            So |0010> is at index 4!

        This is why we use [::-1] (string reverse) in the test.

        The optimal iteration count is floor(pi/4 * sqrt(16)) = 3.

        - 3 iterations gives ~96.5% probability
