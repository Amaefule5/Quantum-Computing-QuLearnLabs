========
Custom quantum gate constructions for Grover's algorithm.

This module provides reusable gate patterns that appear multiple times
in Grover's algorithm. Extracting them into functions makes the main
code cleaner and easier to understand.

KEY CONCEPT: Multi-Controlled-Z (MCZ)
--------------------------------------
Qiskit doesn't have a direct MCZ gate, but we can build one using:
    MCZ = H(target) * MCX(controls, target) * H(target)

Why this works:
    H * X * H = Z

    The Hadamard gate converts between X-basis and Z-basis.
    So wrapping MCX with Hadamards converts it to MCZ.

This is a fundamental technique in quantum circuit design!

    WHY HADAMARD?
    The Hadamard gate creates uniform superposition:
        H|0> = (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2)

    When applied to all qubits starting from |0...0>, it creates
    an equal superposition of ALL possible states:
        H^{⊗n}|0...0> = (1/sqrt(2^n)) * Σ|x>

    This is the "quantum parallelism" that makes Grover's algorithm work!

def apply_multi_controlled_z(circuit, control_qubits, target_qubit):
    """
    Apply a multi-controlled-Z gate using the H-MCX-H trick.

    THE TRICK EXPLAINED:
    -------------------
    A multi-controlled-Z applies a phase flip (-1) ONLY when ALL
    control qubits are |1> AND the target is |1>.

    But Qiskit only has multi-controlled-X (MCX), not MCZ.

    Solution: Use the identity H * X * H = Z

    Circuit:
        target: --H--[MCX]--H--
                    |
        controls: --*----*----*--

    This works because:
        - H converts |0>/|1> to |+>/|-> basis
        - MCX flips in X-basis (which is phase flip in Z-basis)
        - H converts back to Z-basis

def apply_oracle_marker(circuit, solution_string, target_qubit=None):
    """
    Apply the oracle that marks a specific solution with a phase flip.

    HOW IT WORKS:
    ------------
    The oracle needs to apply -1 phase to ONE specific state.

    Strategy:
    1. Flip qubits that are '0' in the solution using X gates
       (This transforms the solution state to |11...1>)
    2. Apply multi-controlled-Z to tag |11...1>
    3. Unflip the qubits (restore original state, now with phase)

    Example for solution "0010" (q3=0, q2=0, q1=1, q0=0):
        Step 1: X on q0, q2, q3 (flip the 0s)
                |0010> becomes |1111>
        Step 2: MCZ tags |1111> with -1 phase
        Step 3: X on q0, q2, q3 again (unflip)
                |1111> becomes |0010>, but with -1 phase!

    Args:
        circuit: The QuantumCircuit to modify
        solution_string: 4-bit string like "0010"
        target_qubit: Which qubit to use as MCZ target 
                      (default: last qubit, num_qubits-1)
    """

def apply_diffusion_operator(circuit):
    """
    Apply the Grover diffusion (amplification) operator.

    WHAT IS DIFFUSION?
    -----------------
    The diffusion operator reflects all amplitudes about the average.

    Intuition:
    - After the oracle, the solution has negative amplitude
    - The average amplitude is slightly positive (most states are positive)
    - Reflecting about this average:
      * The negative solution becomes MORE positive (amplified!)
      * The positive non-solutions become LESS positive (attenuated)

    Mathematical form:
        D = 2|s><s| - I
    where |s> is the uniform superposition state.

    Implementation (same pattern as oracle):
        1. H on all (convert to X-basis)
        2. X on all (flip to |11...1>)
        3. MCZ on |11...1> (phase flip)
        4. X on all (unflip)
        5. H on all (convert back)
